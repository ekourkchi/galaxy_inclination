Code Structure: 
    
    1: Main algorithm and inetrface: 
        inclination_std.py
        
    2: To get command line help:
        python inclination_std.py -h

         GUI_display.py
         
Data Structure:
    
    1: The image of all galaxies are in a folder called "galaxies"
    
    2: The image of the inclination standard galaxies are in a folder called "standards"
    
    3: The input list is "pgc.demo.lst"
    
    4: All the outputs (i.e. the sorted catalog of galaxies) are stored in "pgc.demo.lst.output"
